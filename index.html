    Hello! My name is Tyler Huntley. I am a veteran of the United States Air Force and I spent over 9 years as an HVAC service technician repairing and maintaining heating equipment and building great relationships with my clients. I have a strong attention to detail and I try to live according to the Air Force Core Values to this day. Those Core Values are: integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do. I am currently attending Code Fellows to gain a strong foundation for software development. I plan on applying these learned skills as part of a team, building products (or games) that may bring joy to people of all ages, for generations to come.
